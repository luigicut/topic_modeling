vulnerability_id: CVE-2017-8038
notes:
- text: In Cloud Foundry Foundation Credhub-release version 1.1.0, access control lists (ACLs) enforce whether an authenticated user can perform an operation on a credential. For installations using ACLs, the ACL was bypassed for the CredHub interpolate endpoint, allowing authenticated applications to view any credential within the CredHub installation.
