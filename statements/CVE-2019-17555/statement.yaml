vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-17555
notes:
- text: The AsyncResponseWrapperImpl class in Apache Olingo versions 4.0.0 to 4.6.0 reads the Retry-After header and passes it to the Thread.sleep() method without any check. If a malicious server returns a huge value in the header, then it can help to implement a DoS attack.
