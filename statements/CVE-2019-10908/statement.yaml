vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-10908
notes:
- text: In Airsonic 10.2.1, RecoverController.java generates passwords via org.apache.commons.lang.RandomStringUtils, which uses java.util.Random internally. This PRNG has a 48-bit seed that can easily be bruteforced, leading to trivial privilege escalation attacks.
