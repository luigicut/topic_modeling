vulnerability_id: CVE-2012-4386
notes:
- text: The token check mechanism in Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.4 does not properly validate the token name configuration parameter, which allows remote attackers to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by setting the token name configuration parameter to a session attribute.
